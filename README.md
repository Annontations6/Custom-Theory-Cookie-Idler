> Quoting this from the main instruction text

Welcome to a theory all about cookies and more cookies!!!
You have 3 currencies, cookies(C), heavenly chips(H), and sugar lumps(L), which you'll be spending on upgrades located on both tabs.
Cookies by far is the most important, as the majority of the gameplay revolves around it, from buildings to even tau! You can get your first batch of cookies by buying a cursor, which is gifted to you for free to kickstart your very own cookie empire! By maximizing CPS(C dot), you are sure to produce a whole lot of cookies.
Heavenly Chips are a special type of cookie that forms whenever you sacrificed everything material you own in exchange for greater power(called publications). They can be used for all sorts of special upgrades, and might even end up boosting your CPS if you know enough.
Sugar lumps by far are the hardest to acquire, literally requiring luck in order to get some, but its powers of being able to outright boost your building's CPS by 10%, multiplicative! Rumor has it that it gets easier to acquire the more cookies you have.
